### 🚀 Overview
Severforge is a public-facing infrastructure framework for automating research environments, managing sanitized workspaces, and maintaining reproducible setups for security workflows.  
It’s lightweight, auditable, and built for collaboration.

---

### 🧱 Core Modules
- **`sanitize.sh`** → Cleans environments and removes sensitive logs  
- **`evidence_hash.py`** → Generates SHA256 manifest for audit trails  
- **`clone_env.sh`** → Clones or rebuilds BugArcade VM setups  
- **`setup_env.sh`** → Bootstraps dependencies and directory layout  

---

### 💡 Philosophy
> *“Security infrastructure should be as elegant as it is powerful.”*

Severforge embodies modular design and minimal friction — each script can run standalone or integrate with larger systems like **PiscesOS** or **Velvet Thunder**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**

> Severforge was built for ethical hackers, curious minds, and those who forge with integrity.  
> All automation must be used **legally**, **responsibly**, and **with explicit permission** from target systems.  
> 🧠 Amish and ⚙️ Pisces accept no liability for misuse — only applause for honorable wizardry.
