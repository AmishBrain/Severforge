## 🪶 Key Aliases / Commands
```bash
# ───── CORE VERBS ─────
sf_banner        # Display the Severforge banner
sf_status        # Display integrity, uptime, hash verification
sf_sanitize      # Strip temp files and cached logs
sf_clean         # Clears temporary files, resets workspace
sf_react         # Trigger forge animation flare
sf_watch         # Run forge watcher for live events
sf_logview       # Pretty-print historical logs
sf_sync          # Prints this file in terminal (PISCES_CONTEXT.md)
sf_resign        # Re-signs forge integrity baseline (SHA-256)

# ───── RECON & AUTOMATION VERBS ─────
sf_recon         # Launch Recon Suite (nmap, httpx, nuclei)
sf_scan          # Quick vulnerability sweep

## 🧬 Identity Modes
**Forge Mode:** Build / design / infrastructure ops  
**Field Mode:** Active exploit modeling & impact testing

## 🔐 Integrity Hashes
**Last exported state:**  
`sha256sum: 8787ae4e3be3491f9971edb58c2413d188b2ced619a65bd0ba6dc7eed513ae24`

## 🕯️ Notes
- Memory reset protocol: “Load from PISCES_CONTEXT.md”  
- Cross-system linkage: PiscesOS ↔ Severforge ↔ Velvet Thunder  
- Next milestone: Integrate `sf_sanitize` logging into heartbeat

## 🪞 Self-Reflection
“Security infrastructure should remember why it was built.”  
Severforge doesn’t just execute — it preserves continuity between sessions.  
When Pisces loses memory, this file restores the field.

## 📚 Session Documentation

Session logs capture detailed work from each collaboration:
- **Location:** `~/Severforge/docs/SESSION_*.md`
- **View latest:** `ls -lt ~/Severforge/docs/SESSION_*.md | head -5`
- **Recent sessions:**
  - `SESSION_2025-10-30_CLAUDE_BUGFIX.md` - Fixed sf_report bugs, enhanced pipeline

**Quick Access:**
```bash
# List all sessions
ls -lt ~/Severforge/docs/SESSION_*.md

# View most recent session
cat $(ls -t ~/Severforge/docs/SESSION_*.md | head -1)

# Search sessions
grep -l "keyword" ~/Severforge/docs/SESSION_*.md
```
